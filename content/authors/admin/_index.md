Yu-Xiang Wang is a faculty member of the computer science department in UCSB. Prior to joining UCSB, I was a scientist with Amazon AI in Palo Alto. Even before that I was with the Machine Learning Department in Carnegie Mellon University and had the pleasure of being jointly advised by [Stephen Fienberg](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fienberg/), [Alex Smola](http://alex.smola.org/), [Ryan Tibshirani](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/) and [Jing Lei](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/).

Over the years I have worked on a diverse set of problems in the broad area of statistical machine learning, e.g., trend filtering, differential privacy, subspace clustering, large-scale learning / optimization, bandits / reinforcement learning, just to name a few. Check out my publication page for details. My most recent quests include making differential privacy practical and developing a statistical foundation for off-policy reinforcement learning.
